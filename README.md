# SpeedBreaker One — personal Android fork

This is **onenonlygit's personal, AI-assisted Android ARM64 fork** of
[SpeedBreaker by SpeedBreakerProject / project(u)](https://github.com/SpeedBreakerProject/speedbreaker).
It is an independent experimental adaptation, not an official upstream Android release.
Original authors retain credit for SpeedBreaker's recompilation, runtime,
renderer, UI and artwork. The original banners and screenshots below are retained;
they illustrate upstream SpeedBreaker and are not Android performance claims.

**Current milestone (October 8, 2026):** one complete Quick Race sprint on a
Retroid Pocket 6. Roads/world geometry, cars and HUD now render; music and some
effects play. Engine audio remains missing, performance is roughly 21–30 FPS
in sampled racing logs at internal 720p, and repeated-race stability is unverified.

- [Active Android source branch](https://github.com/onenonlygit/speedbreaker-one/tree/android/rp6-bringup)

The Android build reads the selected ISO directly through Android's file picker;
it does not require a second extracted copy. Supply your own supported game disc
image. No game assets are hosted here. Do not report this fork's Android issues
as upstream-supported Android bugs.

## What is SpeedBreaker?

SpeedBreaker is an unofficial static recompilation of the Xbox 360 version of *Need for Speed:
Most Wanted* (2005): a native port, not an emulator. It runs as an ordinary app on your device
(see [how it works](#how-it-works)).

It is built from the **Xbox 360 version** of the game, not the PC version: it runs the Xbox 360
release's own code, translated ahead of time, and it installs only from the Xbox 360 disc.

You bring the game: SpeedBreaker installs it from a backup of your own disc and checks every
file. Then you race, with things the Xbox 360 couldn't do: up to 4K, ultrawide and tall screens,
and a settings menu you can open mid-race.

## Highlights

- **Up to 4K.** The 3D scene renders at 1x, 2x or 3x the console's 720p (3x is 3840x2160).
  *Auto* picks a scale for your screen and device.
- **Ultrawide done right.** On 21:9 screens the view gets wider instead of stretched, and the
  HUD and the rear-view mirror stay in place. A 4:3 iPad or a 3:2 screen shows more above and
  below instead. 16:10 screens, like the Steam Deck's, keep thin bars.
- **Up to 60 fps,** locked to your 60 Hz display. You can also pick a steady 30 at full game
  speed, or *Auto*, which drops to 30 only while a device is hot or can't hold 60.
- **The sun glare is back.** The low sun glows in open sky and fades behind buildings, as it did
  on the console.
- **The original look:** correct colours on Apple devices, proper car paint and mirror
  reflections, and distant textures that don't shimmer. Anti-aliasing, sharpening and up to 16x
  anisotropic filtering are also available.
- **A guided installer.** It finds your disc image, checks that it is the right game, and
  verifies all 49 files as it copies them. An interrupted install never leaves a broken game.
- **Your controller, or the keyboard.** Controllers work as an Xbox 360 pad, with hot-plugging
  and rumble support.
- **A settings menu that pauses the game.** Open it with F1, Back + Start, or a three-finger
  tap. Every change applies at once.
- **Suspend and resume on iPhone and iPad.** Switch away and the game freezes; come back and it
  carries on where it stopped.
- **One-button bug reports.** Logs, settings and a screenshot go into one zip file. Nothing is
  uploaded, and you decide what to send.

Each link downloads the newest release. Every file and its `.sha256` checksum file are on the
[latest release page][releases]. To check a download, put its `.sha256` file next to it and run
`shasum -a 256 -c SpeedBreaker-macos.dmg.sha256` on a Mac, or
`sha256sum -c SpeedBreaker-steamos-x86_64.tar.xz.sha256` on SteamOS (with your file's name): it
should say OK. What changed in each release is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### System requirements

- **Everyone:** a disc image of your own **USA (NTSC-U) Xbox 360 disc** (see
  [Quick start](#quick-start)), about **7.2 GB** of free space, and a display running at about
  **60 Hz**.
- **Steam Deck, Steam Machine and Linux PCs** (the x86-64 SteamOS download): a 64-bit x86 CPU
  with AVX2 (x86-64-v3): Intel Haswell (2013) or newer, or AMD Excavator, Zen or newer. A
  Vulkan 1.2 graphics card.
- **Steam Frame** (the arm64 SteamOS download): SteamOS on the Steam Frame. The arm64 download
  is for the Frame only; it hasn't been tested on any other arm64 Linux device.
- **Mac:** Apple silicon and **macOS 26** or later. The app won't open on older versions of
  macOS, and there is no Intel Mac build.
- **iPhone and iPad:** iOS or iPadOS 17 or later, on an A15-class chip or newer (iPhone 13 and
  later, M-series iPads), and a controller or keyboard. Devices with less memory than the tested
  ones are untested.

## Quick start

1. **Back up your own disc.** SpeedBreaker supports one version of the game: the **USA (NTSC-U,
   English) Xbox 360 disc**. The installer takes a full `.iso`, a trimmed XISO, or a folder with
   the extracted disc files. No title update is needed. SpeedBreaker doesn't provide game files
   or disc images, or link to them.
2. **Get SpeedBreaker.** [Download it](#download) for Steam Deck, Steam Machine and Steam Frame
   (SteamOS), Linux or Mac. On iPhone and iPad you build it yourself. Then follow the
   [setup for your platform](#setup-by-platform).
3. **Start it and install.** On first run, SpeedBreaker looks for your disc image, checks that
   it is the right game and version, then copies and verifies every file. This takes a few
   minutes at most. Afterwards you can delete the disc image.

   <img src="assets/screenshots/speedbreaker-12-installer-every-file-verified.png" alt="The installer's last page: every file matched the known-good disc" width="600">

4. **Race.** Your saves and settings are kept apart from the game, so they stay when you update
   SpeedBreaker or reinstall the game. The settings open with **F1**, **Back + Start** on a
   controller, or a **three-finger tap** on iPhone and iPad.

## Setup by platform

### Steam Deck and Steam Machine

1. **Download and unpack** (in Desktop Mode). Download the SteamOS build,
   [`SpeedBreaker-steamos-x86_64.tar.xz`][dl-steamos-x86_64]. Make a `Games` folder in your home
   folder, move the file there, and choose *Extract archive here*. Or, in Konsole:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/Games && tar -xf ~/Downloads/SpeedBreaker-steamos-x86_64.tar.xz -C ~/Games
   ```

   Keep it on internal storage or on an SD card formatted by SteamOS, and don't use `:`, `;` or
   `$` in the folder names. To update later, delete the old download, download the new one and
   unpack it over the same folder.

2. **Add it to Steam.** Steam > Games > *Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library* > Browse. Set the
   file type to *All Files* and pick `~/Games/SpeedBreaker/speedbreaker.sh`. Leave
   *Compatibility* (Proton) off: this is a native Linux game.
3. **Put your disc image in Downloads,** or in the top folder of an SD card. SpeedBreaker also
   looks in your home folder, Desktop, Documents, Games, USB drives and EmuDeck's
   `Emulation/roms/xbox360`. Game Mode only sees SD cards and USB drives formatted by SteamOS;
   for a card formatted on a PC, copy the image into Downloads first.
4. **Install** (back in Game Mode). Start SpeedBreaker from your library. It highlights the image
   it found (*Ready to install*; with several, pick yours with Up and Down): press **A**, then
   **A** again on *Install*. Use the images it finds rather than *Browse for image...*, which may
   not open in Game Mode.
5. **Check the screen settings.**
   - **Steam Deck OLED: set the refresh rate to 60 Hz** (Quick Access > Performance). At 90 Hz
     the game stutters. On any Deck, leave the Framerate Limit off.
   - **Docked, or on a Steam Machine:** in the shortcut's Properties > General > Game
     Resolution, choose **Native**.
   - The thin bars above and below the picture on the Deck's screen are intended.

**Controls:** the Deck's controls work through Steam Input (default Gamepad layout).
**Settings:** hold **View** (two squares, left of the screen) and press **Menu** (three lines,
right of the screen).

**Uninstall:** delete `~/Games/SpeedBreaker/`, `~/.local/share/speedbreaker/` (this deletes your
saves too) and `~/.cache/speedbreaker/`, and remove the shortcut from Steam.

### Steam Frame

The Steam Frame has its own download. You set it up on the Frame's desktop: open the
**Desktop** app in your Steam library.

1. **Download and unpack.** Download the Steam Frame build,
   [`SpeedBreaker-steamos-arm64.tar.xz`][dl-steamos-arm64], into Downloads (not
   `SpeedBreaker-steamos-x86_64.tar.xz`: that one is for the Steam Deck, Steam Machine and Linux
   PCs). The Frame's file manager can't unpack it, so open **Konsole** and run:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/Games && tar -xf ~/Downloads/SpeedBreaker-steamos-arm64.tar.xz -C ~/Games
   ```

   This makes `~/Games/SpeedBreaker`. Keep it on the Frame's internal storage, and don't use `:`,
   `;` or `$` in the folder names. To update later, delete the old download, download the new
   one and unpack it over the same folder.

2. **Add it to Steam.** In the file manager, open `~/Games/SpeedBreaker`, right-click
   `speedbreaker.sh` and choose *Add to Steam*. Or, in Konsole:
   `steamos-add-to-steam ~/Games/SpeedBreaker/speedbreaker.sh`. Leave *Compatibility* (Proton)
   off: this is a native Linux game.
3. **Put your disc image in Downloads.** SpeedBreaker also looks in your home folder, Desktop,
   Documents and Games.
4. **Install.** Start SpeedBreaker from your Steam library. It highlights the image it found
   (*Ready to install*): press **A**, then **A** again on *Install*. Or install
   from Konsole: `~/Games/SpeedBreaker/speedbreaker.sh --install ~/Downloads/your-image.iso`
   (with your image's name).

SpeedBreaker plays as a big flat screen in the headset. It is not a VR mode.

- **Settings:** press **Menu + View** together.
- **Frame rate:** set **Display > Frame Rate** to **30 fps** for smooth play. In the headset,
  the VR compositor shares the graphics chip. The game keeps its full speed at 30.
- **Uninstall:** as on the [Steam Deck](#steam-deck-and-steam-machine).

### Linux

There's no separate desktop-Linux package yet. Try the x86-64 SteamOS download,
[`SpeedBreaker-steamos-x86_64.tar.xz`][dl-steamos-x86_64], which brings its own runtime libraries
but hasn't been tested outside SteamOS, or [build from source](#building-from-source). Unpack it,
put your `.iso` in your home folder, Downloads, Desktop, Documents or Games (or on a USB drive),
and run `speedbreaker.sh`. The game starts in a window; Display > Fullscreen switches to full
screen.

### Mac

1. **Download and install.** Download [`SpeedBreaker-macos.dmg`][dl-macos], open it, and drag
   SpeedBreaker to your Applications folder.
2. **Open it.** The app isn't notarized by Apple, so the first time you open it, macOS refuses.
   Close that message (don't move the app to the Trash), then go to **System Settings > Privacy &
   Security**, scroll down to the message about SpeedBreaker, click **Open Anyway** and confirm.
   You only need to do this the first time you open a new download. On current macOS,
   Control-click > Open no longer skips this step.
3. **Put your disc image in a `Games` folder in your home folder** (`~/Games`). That's the only
   place SpeedBreaker looks by itself, so macOS doesn't have to ask for access to your other
   folders. For an image anywhere else, use *Browse for image...*.
4. **Install.** The game goes to `~/Library/Application Support/SpeedBreaker/game`, or to an
   external drive if you choose one.

**Settings:** **F1** or **Cmd+,**, or Back + Start on a controller. The game starts in a window;
Display > Fullscreen switches to full screen. SpeedBreaker needs macOS 26 or later.

### iPhone and iPad

There's no download for iPhone and iPad, and SpeedBreaker isn't on the App Store. You build it
yourself with Xcode on a Mac and install it on your own device, signed with your own Apple
developer account: [scripts/ios/README.md](scripts/ios/README.md) walks you through it.

Once SpeedBreaker is on your device:

1. **Get your disc image onto it.** Copy the `.iso` into **Files > On My iPhone (or iPad) >
   SpeedBreaker**, where it is found by itself. Or tap **Browse** and pick it from anywhere the
   Files app reaches, such as iCloud Drive or a USB drive. A browsed image is read where it is,
   not copied first.
2. **Install.** The game goes into the app's own storage, and is left out of iCloud and computer
   backups (your saves are still backed up). Afterwards you can delete the disc image.
3. **Connect a controller or a keyboard.** The game itself doesn't use touch. Pair a Bluetooth
   controller, such as an Xbox or PlayStation one, or use a Backbone. So far, a Backbone Pro on
   the iPad is the one tested.

**Settings:** tap with **three fingers**, or press Back + Start on the controller (View + Menu on
a Backbone). SpeedBreaker runs in landscape, full screen. If you switch away, the game freezes,
and it resumes exactly where it stopped. If 60 fps isn't steady on your iPhone, set Display >
Frame Rate to 30 fps or Auto.

## Controls

SpeedBreaker hands the game an Xbox 360 controller, so a race plays with the game's own Xbox 360
controls. Buttons are matched **by position**: on a PlayStation controller, Cross is A, Circle
is B, Square is X and Triangle is Y.

| Xbox 360 control | Controller | Keyboard |
|---|---|---|
| Left stick | Left stick | A / D steer (the arrow keys also move it) |
| Right trigger | Right trigger | W |
| Left trigger | Left trigger | S |
| A / B / X / Y | Bottom / right / left / top face button | Space / Backspace / Left Shift / Left Ctrl |
| LB / RB | Shoulder buttons | Q / E |
| D-pad | D-pad | Arrow keys |
| Start | Start / Menu / Options | Enter |
| Back | Back / View / Create | Esc |
| Right stick, stick clicks | Same on the controller | C (right stick click) |

- One player, one controller: the first one connected is used, and you can plug one in at any
  time. The keyboard always works as well.
- Because Back + Start opens the settings, the game sees Back a moment late: a tap arrives when
  you let go, a hold after a quarter of a second.
- There is no button remapping and no mouse control in game.

**To open the settings:**

| Device | Open or close the settings |
|---|---|
| Keyboard | **F1** (on a Mac also **Cmd+,**) |
| Xbox-style controller | **Back + Start** (View + Menu) together |
| Steam Deck | Hold **View**, press **Menu** |
| Steam Frame | **Menu + View** together |
| iPhone and iPad touchscreen | **Three-finger tap** |

## Settings

The game pauses while the settings are open. The D-pad (or arrow keys) chooses and changes a row,
LB and RB (or Q and E) turn pages, and B (or Esc) closes the menu. On a touchscreen, tap and
drag. The mouse works too. Every change applies at once and is saved when you close the menu.
Each page has a *Reset page* button.

<details>
<summary><b>All settings and their defaults</b></summary>

**Display**

| Option | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Fullscreen | On / Off | Off: a 1280x720 window you can resize. Always on in SteamOS Game Mode. Not shown on iPhone and iPad, which are always full screen. |
| V-Sync | On / Off | On. Off can tear, but shows frames sooner. |
| Frame Rate | Auto / 60 fps / 30 fps | 60 fps on most devices. 30 fps keeps the game at full speed. Auto runs at 60, or at a steady 30 while the device is hot or can't hold 60. |
| Screen Resolution | Full / 75% | Full. iPhone and iPad only: 75% is slightly softer and saves graphics work. |
| Aspect Ratio | Fill Screen / 16:9 | Fill Screen: wider screens get a wider view, 4:3 and 3:2 screens a taller one. 16:9 always shows the classic picture with bars. |

**Graphics**

| Option | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Anti-Aliasing | On / Off | On |
| Upscaling | Bicubic / Bilinear | Bicubic |
| Sharpening | 0.00 to 1.00 | 0.30 (0 turns it off) |
| Anisotropic Filtering | Auto / Off / 2x / 4x / 8x / 16x / Original | Auto: 16x on dedicated graphics cards and M-series iPads, 4x elsewhere. Original uses each texture's own setting, as on the 360. |
| Mipmaps | On / Off | On, so distant textures don't shimmer |
| Internal Resolution | Auto / 1x (720p) / 2x (1440p) / 3x (2160p) | Auto: enough to cover your screen, within what the device can afford. On iPhone and iPad, Auto always picks 1x. |

**Audio:** Master Volume (100%), Mute (Off), and Mute in Background (Off), which silences the
game while its window isn't in front.

**Input:** Stick Deadzone (8%; raise it if the car steers by itself), Trigger Deadzone (2%), and
Vibration (On).

**Advanced:** Asynchronous Shaders (On: an object is skipped for a frame or two while its shader
compiles, instead of the game stuttering), Performance Overlay (Off: fps, frame times, and CPU
and GPU time per frame), and **Save Bug Report**. The page also shows which build you're running.

</details>

## Tips for smooth play

- **Run your display at 60 Hz.** On a Steam Deck OLED, set the refresh rate to 60 Hz and leave
  Steam's Framerate Limit off.
- **Start with Auto.** If busy scenes drop below 60, set Internal Resolution one step lower, or
  let Frame Rate *Auto* fall back to a steady 30.
- **30 fps is a real option.** It's a steady 30 at full game speed, and the smooth choice in the
  Steam Frame headset.
- **On iPhone and iPad,** keep Internal Resolution at Auto (1x). On the tested iPad Pro (M2), 2x
  is too slow for races. Screen Resolution 75% saves more.
- **Docked Deck or Steam Machine:** set the shortcut's Game Resolution to Native.
- **See what's happening:** Settings > Advanced > Performance Overlay.

## FAQ and troubleshooting

**Does SpeedBreaker include the game?**
No. No game files are included or distributed. You install the game from your own backup of
your own disc, and SpeedBreaker checks it file by file.

**Which version of the game do I need?**
The Xbox 360 **USA release (NTSC-U, English)**. The installer checks your image and tells you if
it's a different version. PAL and Japanese discs and re-releases haven't been tested, so expect
the installer to refuse them. Games on Demand packages aren't supported, and no title update is
used.

**Does it work with the PC version of the game?**
No. SpeedBreaker is built from the Xbox 360 version and installs only from the Xbox 360 USA disc.
PC copies of *Most Wanted*, including the Black Edition, aren't supported.

**Is this an emulator?**
No. It's a static recompilation: the game's Xbox 360 code was translated ahead of time into a
native app, so that code runs directly instead of being emulated. SpeedBreaker supplies what the
game expects from the Xbox 360: its system software, graphics, audio and controllers.

**Can it run above 60 fps?**
No. 60 fps is the game's own cap.

**Can I bring my Xbox 360 saves?**
No. Xbox 360 saves can't be imported, so your career starts fresh.

**The installer refused my image. Why?**
It always says what to do. The usual causes:

- *Another game, or an unsupported version:* it isn't the USA disc.
- *Truncated image:* most often a copy cut off at 4 GB by a FAT32 drive. Copy it again from your
  own backup, onto a drive that can hold files over 4 GB.
- *Not a disc image,* a Games on Demand package, or a video-only DVD image.
- *Missing or corrupt files:* make a new backup from your disc.

**My Mac says SpeedBreaker can't be opened.** Use **Open Anyway** in System Settings > Privacy &
Security (see [Mac setup](#mac)).

**The game stutters on my Steam Deck OLED.** Set the screen to 60 Hz (see
[Steam Deck setup](#steam-deck-and-steam-machine)).

**The picture is small or stretched on my TV or monitor in Game Mode.** Set the shortcut's
Properties > General > Game Resolution to Native.

**My Deck shows bars above and below the picture.** That's intended: the game is 16:9 and the
Deck's screen is 16:10.

**My SD card or USB drive doesn't show up in Game Mode.** Game Mode only sees drives formatted by
SteamOS. Copy the image into Downloads from Desktop Mode.

**The car steers by itself.** Raise Settings > Input > Stick Deadzone.

**The game ignores my touches on iPhone or iPad.** The game needs a controller or a keyboard.
Touch only works in SpeedBreaker's own screens; a three-finger tap opens the settings.

**Where are my saves, settings and logs?**

| | Linux and SteamOS | Mac | iPhone and iPad |
|---|---|---|---|
| Saves, settings, logs | `~/.local/share/speedbreaker/` | `~/Library/Application Support/SpeedBreaker/` | Inside the app (not shown in the Files app) |
| Installed game | `game/` in that folder, or `speedbreaker/game` on a drive | `game/` in that folder, or `SpeedBreaker/game` on a drive | Inside the app |
| Shader caches (safe to delete) | `~/.cache/speedbreaker/` | `~/Library/Caches/SpeedBreaker/` | Inside the app |

Deleting that folder, or deleting the iPhone or iPad app, deletes your saves.

### Reporting a bug

1. Open the settings, go to **Advanced**, and choose **Save Bug Report**.
2. A notice says where the zip file went: your **Desktop** (on SteamOS, pick it up in Desktop
   Mode, or in the Desktop app on a Steam Frame), the **SpeedBreaker** folder in the Files app on
   iPhone and iPad, or the data folder above when there is no Desktop. Its name says which
   version you were running, for example `speedbreaker-bug-report-v0.1.0-<date>_<time>.zip`.
3. Open an [issue][issues], attach the zip, and say what you were doing, what you expected, what
   happened, and roughly how long into the session it happened.

The zip holds recent logs, any crash and hang reports, your settings, a summary of your system
and a screenshot of the last game frame. Paths in your home folder show as `~`. If the game
crashed, start it again and save a report: the crash report is included. **Never attach game
files or disc images to an issue.**

## What's next

- **Windows:** coming soon.
- **Android:** coming soon.

**One more thing… SpeedBreaker: Carbon, coming soon.** It's planned, not available yet.

There are no dates and no promises: it's ready when it's ready.

## For developers

### How it works

SpeedBreaker is a **static recompilation**. [XenonRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp)
translates the game's PowerPC code into C++ ahead of time, and that C++ is compiled into a
native program for x86-64 or arm64. A runtime written for this project stands in for the Xbox
360: its kernel and system software, its GPU, its XMA audio and its controllers.

- **Graphics:** a Vulkan renderer that translates the Xenos GPU's commands and shaders. On Mac,
  iPhone and iPad it runs on Metal through MoltenVK.
- **Platform layer:** SDL3 for windows, input and audio. The installer, the settings menu and the
  overlay are drawn with Dear ImGui.
- **Audio:** XMA decoding done the way the hardware does it, frame by frame, with a patched,
  decoder-only FFmpeg.
- **Resolution:** the 3D scene renders at 1x, 2x or 3x; the bloom and haze stay at the original
  resolution, so the game keeps its colour grade.
- **Frame pacing:** the game's clock locks to the display's measured refresh (58.5 to 61.5 Hz),
  one game step per refresh. 30 fps runs two game steps per frame.
- **Sun glare:** the game measures the sun with occlusion queries; SpeedBreaker counts them on
  the GPU.

The game's data (cars, city, audio, movies) comes from the player's disc. SpeedBreaker contains
no game data or assets.

### Command-line installer

The installer also runs from a terminal. On SteamOS, run it through `speedbreaker.sh`; on a Mac,
the program is `SpeedBreaker.app/Contents/MacOS/SpeedBreaker`.

```sh
SpeedBreaker --install <image or folder> [--dest <dir>]   # install
SpeedBreaker --verify <image or folder>                   # check every file without copying
SpeedBreaker --find-images                                # list the disc images it can find
SpeedBreaker --where                                      # show where the game is installed
```

### Building from source

The repository contains no game code: the build recompiles your own `default.xex`, from the USA
disc. The generated code (`ppc/`), the game files (`game/`) and the toolchain (`tools/`) are
ignored by git. **Never commit or share them.**

The supported executable is 3,936,256 bytes, with SHA-256
`aebdf3c14d1e4e4ed2c130d94bc1a0e97bd6d5bf39bdfdef33c3909c9cc4ba4c`.

#### 1. Dependencies

- **Mac:** Xcode's command-line tools, and from Homebrew: `brew install llvm lld cmake ninja sdl3
  molten-vk vulkan-loader vulkan-headers glslang spirv-tools`
- **SteamOS:** build inside an Arch Linux distrobox (podman and distrobox ship with SteamOS). The
  development launcher, `scripts/steamos/speedbreaker.sh`, expects the container to be called
  `nfsmw-build`:

  ```sh
  distrobox create --yes --name nfsmw-build --image docker.io/library/archlinux:latest \
    --additional-packages "clang lld cmake ninja git python sdl3 vulkan-headers \
      vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-tools glslang spirv-tools mesa vulkan-radeon pkgconf \
      make diffutils patch curl nasm libpulse pipewire pipewire-pulse alsa-lib libdecor"
  distrobox enter nfsmw-build
  ```

- **Other Linux distributions:** your distribution's equivalents of the package list above
  (Clang 18 or newer). Untested so far. The GPU needs Vulkan 1.2 and BC (DXT) texture support.
- `gh`, logged in, is optional: it fetches Xenia's instruction tests.

#### 2. Toolchain, your game files, recompilation

From the repository root:

```sh
scripts/setup_tools.sh    # XenonRecomp + SpeedBreaker's patches, extract-xiso, FFmpeg's XMA decoder

# Extract your own disc image into game/files and check the executable.
mkdir -p game/files
tools/extract-xiso/build/extract-xiso -d game/files -x /path/to/your-backup.iso
shasum -a 256 game/files/default.xex
# must print aebdf3c14d1e4e4ed2c130d94bc1a0e97bd6d5bf39bdfdef33c3909c9cc4ba4c

# Translate the game's code into C++ (writes ppc/).
mkdir -p ppc
tools/XenonRecomp/build/XenonRecomp/XenonRecomp config/nfsmw.toml tools/XenonRecomp/XenonUtils/ppc_context.h
```

#### 3. Build

```sh
# Linux and SteamOS (on SteamOS, inside the container)
cmake -S . -B build/main -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++

# Mac (Homebrew's LLVM)
cmake -S . -B build/main -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++

ninja -C build/main SpeedBreaker
```

Run `build/main/runtime/SpeedBreaker` from the repository root. With the whole disc extracted in
`game/files`, it plays from there. Otherwise the first-run installer asks for your disc image.

#### 4. Package it (optional)

- **Mac app:** `python3 scripts/macos/make_app.py` makes `build/app/SpeedBreaker.app`, with its
  libraries, MoltenVK and the license notices inside. Add `--dmg` for
  `build/app/SpeedBreaker-macos.dmg` and its `.sha256`, laid out like the download on Releases.
- **SteamOS bundle (x86-64):** inside the container, `scripts/steamos/make_bundle.sh` makes
  `build/bundle/SpeedBreaker-steamos-x86_64.tar.xz` and its `.sha256` (plus a copy named by the
  version, `SpeedBreaker-<version>-steamos-x86_64.tar.xz`). Install it as described in
  [Steam Deck setup](#steam-deck-and-steam-machine).
- **Steam Frame bundle (arm64):** the Steam Frame download on Releases is built on a Frame, and
  so is your own: the Frame's SteamOS ships clang, CMake, Ninja, glslang and the Vulkan headers,
  so no container is needed. Build an SDL3 release into `~/deps/sdl3` (with
  `-DSDL_X11_XSCRNSAVER=OFF`), and do step 2 on the Frame (another machine's FFmpeg build won't
  link there). Then:

  ```sh
  cmake -S . -B build/main -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DSDL3_DIR=$HOME/deps/sdl3/lib/cmake/SDL3 \
    -DCMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH=ON
  ninja -C build/main
  scripts/steamos/make_bundle.sh build/main build/bundle
  ```

  This makes `build/bundle/SpeedBreaker-steamos-arm64.tar.xz` and its `.sha256` (plus a copy
  named by the version). `-DCMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH=ON` keeps your `~/deps` folder out of the
  program: the bundle brings SDL3 in its own `lib/`. Install it as described in [Steam Frame setup](#steam-frame).
- **iPhone and iPad:** `scripts/ios/build_deps.sh` builds the iOS libraries, and
  `scripts/ios/build.sh` builds, signs and installs the app. The steps, and signing with your own
  Apple developer account, are in [scripts/ios/README.md](scripts/ios/README.md).

#### Tests

The unit tests build with `-DSB_TESTS=ON` added to the `cmake` line, and
`ctest --test-dir build/main` runs them. `tests/run_instr_tests.sh` checks the instructions
SpeedBreaker's patches add to XenonRecomp. It needs LLVM's `llvm-mc` and `llvm-objdump` and
`ld.lld`: on a Mac, Homebrew's `llvm` and `lld`; elsewhere, your distribution's (on Arch, the
`llvm` and `lld` packages; the container above has only `lld`). `LLVM=<bin dir>` and
`LLD=<ld.lld>` pick others. So far it has been run on a Mac only. None of the tests needs game
files; `write_watch_test` needs `ppc/`.
