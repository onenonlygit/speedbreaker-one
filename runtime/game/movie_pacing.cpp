// Movies on whole pairs of vblanks.
//
// The game's movies (29.97 fps WMVs) play through the XDK's XMV player. Its
// render call (sub_826E8CF8, the player's vtable slot 18, from the game's
// movie update sub_8245DD20) works out how many whole milliseconds are left
// until the next frame is due, Sleeps that long and renders the frame; the
// game then swaps with presentation interval ONE. D3D's swap sync
// (sub_82598670) has the command processor raise an interrupt whose
// callback (sub_825985A0, argument 0x0001000A: interval 1, immediate
// threshold 10%) sets how many vblank interrupts to wait, and the CP's
// WAIT_REG_MEM on 0x06449006 lets the swap through when the vblank
// interrupt (sub_82597768) counts that down: the frame goes out at the first
// vblank after the CP reaches the swap. The player's clock (sub_826DCA50) is
// the performance counter in whole ms against a base that, by the
// disassembly, its audio side moves to "now minus the audio played"
// (sub_826DCCF0), and the audio moves 256 samples (5.33 ms) at a time. So
// the kicks scatter around their ideal times: over 4 s of the attract movie
// (Steam Machine, nested gamescope at 60 Hz) they sat -5.6..+5.8 ms (sd 2.4
// ms) from a straight line, with 5-8 ms steps. The sleeps wake on time (10 us
// late) and the WAIT_REG_MEM ends 0.05-0.15 ms after the vblank interrupt.
// While the kicks' phase is within that scatter of a vblank, frames fall on
// either side of it and show for 1 and 3 vblanks instead of 2 and 2: 7-10% of
// movie frames (the "WAIT_REG_MEM" late frames of the player's hitch reports).
//
// At 60 Hz, or the rate the vblank locks to (the Deck's panel: 60.16 Hz),
// a 29.97 fps movie's phase crosses a vblank every 4.6-17 s. So a movie
// frame that would go out one vblank after the last one waits for the next
// vblank when its swap came less than the guard (10 ms) before that vblank:
// a kick that early is the clock's scatter, not a movie running ahead. One
// that comes earlier still (a clock faster than two vblanks a frame) goes out
// at once: that is where such a movie needs its 1. A late frame can't be
// helped, so a 3 stays a 3, but the frames after it keep the later phase,
// clear of the next vblank: a slow clock gets one 3 per crossing and no 1.
// A held frame shows one vblank later than it would have
// (tests/movie_cadence_sim.py replays the measured scatter).
//
// Only frames the XMV player rendered are held, after four movie frames of
// two vblanks or more in a row, at guest vblank rates near 60 Hz (RefreshFit's
// range, which takes in the free-running 16.667 ms under a display the lock
// rejects, 120 Hz say): the game's own frames, and anything that runs at a
// vblank a frame, are never touched.
// NFSMW_MOVIE_CADENCE=0 turns it off, NFSMW_MOVIE_CADENCE=<ms> sets the
// guard (default 10, at most 12). Each movie leaves a [movie] line: its
// frames by vblanks shown, and those held.
