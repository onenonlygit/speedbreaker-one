// Tests for the write watch (runtime/kernel/write_watch.cpp) around CPU write
// faults on hosts whose pages hold several 4 KB guest pages (16 KB on Apple):
// NFSMW_WATCH_SUBPAGES=1 marks just the faulting guest page and compares the
// host page's others before anything reads their sequences. From the repo root:
//   clang++ -std=c++20 -O2 -pthread -Iruntime -Iruntime/kernel -Iruntime/thirdparty/o1heap -Ippc
//     -Itools/XenonRecomp/XenonUtils -Itools/XenonRecomp/thirdparty/simde tests/write_watch_test.cpp

//   build/write_watch_test
// Started without NFSMW_WATCH_SUBPAGES (whose default differs by platform),
// it runs itself with it at 0 (a write fault marks every guest page of its
// host page, as before) and at 1 (in use only where host pages are over 4 KB:
// a 4 KB host, where a host page is a guest page, checks the old rule both
// times); with it set, it runs once. Physical memory
// is mapped as the runtime maps it (three windows of one shared object), and
// SIGSEGV and SIGBUS go to HandleFault as main.cpp sends them. Under a second.
